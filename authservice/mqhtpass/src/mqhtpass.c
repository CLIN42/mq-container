/**

 * deal with non-standard user IDs, which perhaps are longer than 12
 * characters. The CorrelationPtr can be assigned in this function to
 * point to some OAM-managed storage, and is available as part of the
 * MQZED structure for all subsequent functions. Note that there is only
 * one CorrelPtr stored for the user's hconn, so if two OAMs are chained
 * and both want to manage storage for the connection, there would be
 * difficulties as there is no reverse call that would allow the second
 * to reset the first's pointer (or vice versa). I'd suggest instead
 * using something like thread-specific storage as each thread is tied
 * to the hconn.
 *
 * When a clntconn/svrconn channel connects to the queue manager, the
 * authentication is supposed to take two stages. First as the
 * channel program connects, and then as the MCAUSER is set. You will
 * see this as "initial" and "change" context values in the parameters.
